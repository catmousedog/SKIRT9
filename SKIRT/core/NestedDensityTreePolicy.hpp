/** NestedDensityTreePolicy is a tree policy that allows for nesting DensityTreePolicies, enabling
    users to define a region containing another density tree. The inner and outer regions can have
    different properties, utilizing all properties from DensityTreePolicy.

    This class inherits from DensityTreePolicy and uses all the inherited properties to classify the
    outer region. Additionally, it introduces an additional property called nestedTree, which is
    also a DensityTreePolicy. The nestedTree property decides the properties of the inner region.

    The nestedTree property can also be another NestedDensityTreePolicy, allowing for recursive
    nesting. 

    When determining whether a TreeNode intersects with the inner 'nested' region, if it does, the
    node will be subdivided. This can result in a smooth transition, as larger TreeNodes may only
    need to subdivide once or a few times, making them no longer intersect with the inner region.
    Boxes that just intersect the inner region, especially at the edge, will only subdivide a few
    times before they no longer intersect, providing a relatively smooth transition from the outer
    to inner region. */
